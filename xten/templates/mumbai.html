  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">About Mumbai</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">Mumbai, previously known as Bombay is one of the
    most populous and biggest cities of Maharashtra. Also the biggest metropolis of this state, Mumbai is also popular
    as the entertainment and financial capital. It is the largest city of India and fondly called as the city of dreams.
    It is a place filled with dreamers and people who work hard day and night to achieve their dreams. From struggling
    actors, laboureres, Bollywood stars to gangsters, Mumbai has a lot. A lot that can be written about and talked
    about! Mumbai is also home to one of the biggest slum area as well as home to the richest and thus it is only fair
    to describe Mumbai as a city for all. The majorsly spoken language is definitely Hindi , but this city has welcomed
    people from all faiths and religion warmly. If you want to know and experience diversity, visit Mumbai. This city
    also has its very own language that is the Bambaiiya Hindi. Known to be a city filled with warm and friendly people,
    we believe that anything written about Mumbai is never enough.

    If you are planning to visit Mumbai, trust us when we say it may look intimidating initially, but it is not. In fact
    it is one of the friendliest cities of India. The extreme energy and the fast paced life of the people here cannot
    be easily matched. The heart of Mumbai has some of the best and beautiful colonial architecture and if you venture
    out to the lesser known lanes, you will also come across several distinct bazaars, temples, fancy restaurants and a
    nightlife that is one of its kinds. Before Mumbai became the city hat it is now, it was a collection of seven
    islands which was eventually formed to form Bombay. It was given to the British as dowry to Charles II who married
    Catherine of Braganza. The island city that Mumbai is today is owing to these reclamation and these islands were
    home to several fishing colonies. The British made Mumbai an important port since it was already had a natural
    harbor but it rose to its richness during the American Civil War when cotton supplies were completely stopped from
    America to Britain. India made the most of this situation and it is said that traders earned approximately 80
    million pounds which is a lot of money. This made way for Bombay’s very own merchant traders who were rich. As you
    walk around in the many lanes of South Bombay you will still get to witness the remnants of this city’s glorious
    past. Cotton factories and many buildings that are dilapidated are still to be seen scattered around many parts of
    Mumbai, especially South Mumbai. Apart from this, another every interesting par about this city is that in spite of
    the several unfortunate incidents and acts of terrorism this city has seen, it still moves on and lives with the
    same love for Mumbai.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">Best places to visit</h2><br><br>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">1. Sanjay Gandhi National Park</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    Located in between Mumbai and Thane, Sanjay Gandhi National Park is one of the most liked national parks, and is
    known for its picnic spots. The park also has a variety of wildlife that includes leopards, macaques, bears, lions,
    flying fox, kingfisher, sunbirds and a significant number of butterflies. It is also home to the very historic and
    famous tourist attractions, Kanheri Caves that have been carved out of rocky cliffs. The park is also said to be the
    largest park in the world located within city limits. Amenities like Cycling, trekking, Lion and Tiger Safari,
    Camping, and Hiking make the experience of being here even more exciting and fun.

  <br><br>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">2. Juhu Beach</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    Juhu Beach is one of the most famous Indian beaches and is known to be more visited than any other beach. This site
    is another picnic spot in Mumbai where people visit when they wish to relax after their busy bustling days. The
    beach is bordered by a posh locality where many celebrities live, and hence it is most common to see them running,
    walking, jogging around the beach. It has also been a shooting location for many famous Bollywood movies. Besides,
    the beach is also very famous for its boating. Many people who live around the beach also visit the place for the
    very famous local cuisines available here, including Pani Puri, Bhel Puri, Vada Pav, Pav Bhaji, etc.

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">3. Razzberry rhinoceros</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    Not-so-popular but a very iconic place in the city, with a perfect blend of sun, sea, and food. This place is a
    beachside lounge, with varied cuisine. Razz was once a music place. Currently, it is more than a live performance
    venue with its performance area, wine and coffee bistro, outside deck, and an upstairs area reserved for the members
    and loyalists. The gig area aka the inside eating area has been minimally retaining its simplicity. This is thus,
    another sanctuary for Mumbaikars to go and hide.
