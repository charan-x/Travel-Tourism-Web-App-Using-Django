  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">About Goa</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">‘Now our road takes us to the magnificent kingdom
    of Goa.The people of this kingdom are strong, prudent and very hardworking. The kingdom of Goa is the most important
    in India.It is civilized, having famous orchards and water. It is the coolest place in India and it is the most
    plentiful in foodstuffs.’

    ‘The white people make a practice of going to the kingdom of Goa to enjoy the shade and the groves of trees and to
    savour the sweet betel.’

    These revealing remarks on Goa come not from the hippies or ‘flower power’ generation of the sixties and early
    seventies who thronged the beaches of Anjuna, Vagator and Arambol in search of salvation and ‘peace’. These remarks
    were made over five centuries ago by the Portuguese Ambassador to China who visited Goa around the year 1511. They
    serve as a vivid precursor to the generations that followed in our times to the fabled land of Goa.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">Best places to visit</h2><br><br>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">1. Beaches Off the Beaten Path</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    While known for their spectacular scenery, the popular beaches in Goa tend to get crowded during high season,
    leaving some travelers eager for a quieter natural escape. Fortunately, Goa brims with undiscovered beach
    attractions that give you some distance from the throngs of tourists while still treating you to glorious sand and
    surf.

    One of the best hidden gems in Goa is Butterfly Beach. It has a curving expanse of sand flanked by boulders that
    create a postcard-worthy cove, brimming with butterflies and blossoms. It's also a great spot to watch dolphins swim
    in the distance.

    You'll need to embark on a boat ride from Palolem Beach or Agonda Beach, or tackle a challenging forest hike, to
    reach Butterfly Beach — but the obstacles to getting here help to thin out the crowds. You might even have the place
    to yourself.

    While more developed than Butterfly Beach, Utorda Beach is another stunning getaway from the more crowded beaches
    around Goa. It features clean, blue water; silky sand; and a few small beach shacks. Look closely as you wade in the
    water, and you may spot some small starfish.

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">2. Basilica de Bom Jesus</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    While many tourists visit Goa for the beaches, countless others consider the trip to be a pilgrimage to important
    religious sites, like the Basilica de Bom Jesus.

    This Old Goa attraction dates back to the late 16th century and contains the remains of the St. Francis Xavier. The
    "Apostle of the Indies" co-founded the Society of Jesus religious order with friend St. Ignatius Loyola and
    spearheaded an extensive mission in India. The basilica has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1999.

    The modest yet imposing structure is a mix of Doric, Corinthian, and Baroque style with intricate carvings.
    Interestingly, the building was stripped of its lime plaster in the mid-20th century, making it the only church in
    Goa without plaster. The Basilica de Bom Jesus has since become worn by monsoons.

    You can tour the church on your own, or hire one of the independent guides near the entrance for a small fee.
    Inside, you can see huge ornamental screens, along with the body of the resident saint in a casket that was once
    covered in precious stones. It's a compelling place that will transport you back in time.

    Every year, the Feast of St. Francis Xavier draws big crowds to this church in late November and early December. It
    kicks off with a nine-day novena and open-air masses before concluding with the major holiday on Dec. 3.

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">3. Dudhsagar Falls</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    Aquatic adventures go beyond the beach in Goa. The state is also home to Dudhsagar Falls, a spectacular four-tiered
    waterfall that towers some 310 meters above the earth. It's one of India's tallest waterfalls and a perpetually
    popular attraction for day trips around Goa and Karnataka.

    To reach the falls, you'll need to make your way to the village of Colem by taxi or train. Depending on which train
    route you take, you may get a glimpse of Dudhsagar Falls along the way. Then, you'll hop aboard a shared jeep
    through the jungle, passing Devil's Canyon along the way. Around 45 minutes later, you'll scurry over some boulders
    to finally reach the falls.

    The best time to visit Dudhsagar Falls is right after the monsoon, when the water is gushing. Tourists who wish to
    take a dip can rent a life jacket from vendors at the attraction.
