  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">About Mysore</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    Mysore[14] (/maɪˈsɔːr/ (About this soundlisten)), officially Mysuru ([ˈmaɪ'suːɾu] (About this soundlisten)), is a
    city in the southern part of the state of Karnataka, India.[15] Mysore city is geographically located between 12°
    18′ 26″ north latitude and 76° 38′ 59″ east longitude. It is located at an altitude of 770 m (2,530 ft) above mean
    sea level.

    Mysore is located in the foothills of the Chamundi Hills about 145.2 km (90 mi) towards the southwest of Bangalore
    and spread across an area of 286.05 km2 (110 sq mi). Mysore City Corporation is responsible for the civic
    administration of the city, which is also the headquarters of the Mysore district and the Mysore division. In
    November 2020, A gazetted notification was passed by the state government converting nearby census town of
    Hootagalli into a City Municipal Council along with four more Town Panchayats of Bhogadi, Kadakola, Rammanahalli and
    Srirampura, expanding the city area from 155.7 sq.km to 286.05 sq.km.[16][17] This also increased the population of
    the urban agglomeration from 990,900 to 1,060,120.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22] According to United Nations, Mysuru
    is projected to have a population of 1.162 million in 2018, making it the second largest city in the state.[23]

    It served as the capital city of the Kingdom of Mysore for nearly six centuries from 1399 until 1956. The Kingdom
    was ruled by the Wadiyar dynasty, with a brief period of interregnum in the late 18th century when Hyder Ali and
    Tipu Sultan were in power. The Wadiyars were patrons of art and culture. Tipu Sultan and Hyder Ali also contributed
    significantly to the cultural and economic growth of the city and the state by planting mulberry trees introducing
    silk in the region and fighting 4 Anglo-Mysore wars against the British. The cultural ambience and achievements of
    Mysore earned it the sobriquet Cultural Capital of Karnataka.

    Mysore is noted for its heritage structures and palaces, including the Mysore Palace, and for the festivities that
    take place during the Dasara festival when the city receives many tourists from around the world. It lends its name
    to various art forms and culture, such as Mysore Dasara, Mysore painting; the sweet dish Mysore Pak, Mysore Masala
    Dosa; brands such as Mysore Sandal Soap, Mysore Ink; and styles and cosmetics such as Mysore Peta (a traditional
    silk turban) and the Mysore silk saris. Mysore is also known for its special variety of jasmine flower fondly
    referred as "Mysore Mallige" and betel leaves. Tourism is the major industry alongside the traditional industries.
    Mysore's inter-city public transportation includes rail, bus and flights.[24]</p>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">Best places to visit</h2><br><br>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">1. Mysore Maharaja Palace (Amba Vilas), Mysore</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    A trip to Mysore cannot be called complete if you don’t visit the famous Maharaja Palace. In fact, the palace should
    rank top in your itinerary. Situated in the heart of the city, this iconic structure has mesmerized people from all
    over the world and now boasts of over 6 million annual visitors. This majestic palace used to be the royal residence
    of the Wodiyar dynasty and is known for its Indo-Saracenic architectural design. Stepping into this palace will make
    your jaw drop, both literally as well as figuratively. Such is its splendor! From the intricate designs on tall
    columns to the detailed roof artwork on the ceiling, the palace is a visual treat to the eyes. Plan your itinerary
    in such a way that you get time to watch the sound and light show in the evening to get a better understanding of
    the history of Mysore.
    Or even better, plan your trip during the festival of Dasara which usually falls in the month of September or
    October. Mysore Dasara or Nada Habba is celebrated in the palace with much fanfare and joviality. The golden throne
    on which the great rulers of the Kingdom of Mysore sat is kept for display during this festival. You will find the
    palace packed with men and women dressed in festive wear. Even though you will find yourself lost in a mob of
    people, watching the procession and the entire festivities during this time of the year is totally worth it. Also,
    the Amba Vilas is one of the most beautiful places to visit in Mysore at night. You will be amazed by the grandeur
    of the lit-up palace, giving you a hint of its former glories.

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">2. Chamundeshwari Temple, Mysore</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    More often than not, places of worship form an integral part of any city’s past and this goes true for the
    Chamundeshwari Temple in Mysore as well. Located atop Chamundi Hills, this is one of the most famous temples in
    South India. The temple was constructed by the Wodeyar family as a dedication to their family deity, Goddess Durga.
    It is built in the Dravidian style and has an ornate seven-tier pyramidal tower at the entrance. There are two ways
    to reach the temple – by driving up the hill or by climbing up the 1,000 steps. If you take the steps, you will also
    come across troops of monkeys on either side! Many iconic landmarks in the city such as Mysore Palace, Lalitha Mahal
    Palace, Krishna Raja Sagar, and St. Philomena’s Church can be spotted from the hills.

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">3. Karanji Lake</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    If you are an avid bird watcher, Karanji Lake Nature Park is where you should visit while you are in Mysore. It is
    considered a bird paradise that attracts many ornithologists and other nature enthusiasts. You get to meet a lot of
    sundry bird species like the great and little cormorants, purple and grey herons, egrets, black bises, rose-ringed
    parakeets, green bee-eaters, painted storks and a variety of butterflies.
    While it looks like a serene and calm lake now, there is an interesting story attached to the lake park. It was
    previously Doddakere, a garbage dump which got transformed into an ideal place for the birds to come and hang out.
    The lake park is situated in the heart of the city. One can get a breathtaking view of the Chamundi hills from the
    lake park.
