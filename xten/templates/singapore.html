  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">About Singapore</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">Though physically small, Singapore is an economic
    giant. It has been Southeast Asia's most modern city for over a century. The city blends Malay, Chinese, Arab,
    Indian and English cultures and religions. Its unique ethnic tapestry affords visitors a wide array of sightseeing
    and culinary opportunities from which to choose. A full calendar of traditional festivals and holidays celebrated
    throughout the year adds to its cultural appeal. In addition, Singapore offers luxury hotels, delectable cuisine and
    great shopping! The island nation of the Republic of Singapore lies one degree north of the Equator in Southern
    Asia. The country includes the island of Singapore and 58 or so smaller islands. Because of its efficient and
    determined government, Singapore has become a flourishing country that excels in trade and tourism and is a model to
    developing nations. The capital city, also called Singapore, covers about a third of the area of the main island.

    Located at the tip of the Malay Peninsula, Singapore's tropical climate welcomes both leisure and business travelers
    year round. The island republic's excellent infrastructure enables visitors to enjoy its many sites and attractions
    in a safe, clean and green environment. Award winning Changi Airport provides airlinks to major cities around the
    world. The train and subway systems are clean, fast and efficient. In addition, its state-of-the-art cruise terminal
    has established Singapore as one of the premier cruising centers of South East Asia and an exciting port of call on
    any Asian cruise itinerary.

    In the city, there is no need for a car. Public transportation is excellent and walking is a good way to explore the
    city . All major attractions are also accessible by tour bus. Since the city is only 60 miles (100k) from the
    equator, the tropical temperatures do not vary much. Rainfall is fairly evenly distributed through the year. No
    matter when you choose to visit, warm weather will be abundantly available. The visitor is struck immediately by
    Singapore's abundance of parks, nature reserves, and lush, tropical greenery.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">Best places to visit</h2><br><br>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">1. Gardens by the Bay</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    Unquestionably, this place receives a lot of admiration and a must see attraction on every travellers list. Gardens
    by the Bay will take you to an imaginative place and it is a tourist hot-spot for all the good reason. The Marina
    Bay holds amazing Supertree Grove and it is comeliest at night.

    It gives an impression of being in an imaginative place with all sorts of attractions to visit such as Flower Dome
    and Cloud Forest which gives an eye-popping sight to the spectators. The Gardens by the Bay complex is divided into
    three bays – central, east and south. Thankfully, it contains a promenade where you can stop for a coffee or dine
    when the tour gets tiresome.

  <br><br>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">2. Little India and Arab Street</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    The Arab Street and Little India are popular tourism places and they create a unique experience of its own. You will
    feel unlatched from the modern city to a paradise like place fitted with small shops, cosy cafes and historical
    Mosques. The Arab Street to be specific has age-old structures, shopping stalls, and authentic Arabian cuisine, the
    feel it offers is heavenly.

    The Little India, on the other hand, was actually an Indian community in Singapore during the colonial times. Just
    like the Arabian Streets that have many stalls and Mosques, Little India as well has a number of exquisite shopping
    options; eateries offering Indian cuisine; and temples like Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, which is the most famous
    Hindu temple to see here.

  <br><br>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">3. Singapore Flyer</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    The best way to see Singapore is from above. Think about it, you get a birds-eye view of the entire city. Perhaps
    make plans on which place to stopover, even better, dwell in the moment and watch the sun slide down (If you happen
    to visit during sun downing). Singapore Flyer is basically an observation wheel which surges 165 metres and it is
    Asia’s largest giant wheels.

    At the flyer, you can get insight of the technology behind the wheel and also get a sneak peek into the history and
    evolution of Singapore. This ride can brush your knowledge and thus, it is the best attractions for kids. Make sure
    to visit this place during your city tour for a breathtaking view overlooking the F1 track, Gardens by the Bay,
    views of the skyline and parts of Malaysia as well as Indonesia.
