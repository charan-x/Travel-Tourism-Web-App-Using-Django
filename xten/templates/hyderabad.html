  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">About Hyderabad</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">Hyderabad city is the capital city of the Indian
    state of Telangana. The city has an estimated population of around 8 million, making it 4th largest city in India ,
    while the population of the metropolitan area was estimated above 9 million. Religiously and culturally, the city is
    united with Hindus, Muslims and Christians. Hyderabad city is known for its rich history, food and its multi-lingual
    culture, both geographically and culturally. Founded in the year 1591 by fifth Qutb Shahi Ruler Muhammad Quli Qutb
    Shah.

    The original city of Hyderabad was founded on the banks of river Musi. Now known as the historic old city, home to
    the Charminar, Falaknuma Palace, Chowmallah Palace and Makkah Masjid, it lies on the southern bank of the river.
    Hyderabad and Secunderabad are twin cities, separated by the Husain Sagar (bound by the ‘Tank Bund’), a man made
    lake made during the time of Ibrahim Qutb Shah in 1562.

    Ruled by the Qutub Shahis, the city has a history of nearly 400 years. The capital Bhagyanagar was named after a
    royal beloved Bhagyamati, who later as the wife of Quli Qutub Shah became Hyder Mahal and thus was born Hyderabad.
    Hyderabad was founded on the River Musi five miles east of Golconda, the capital of the Qutub Shahi rulers in
    1591-92 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah. The Qutb Shahi dynasty founded the Kingdom of Golconda, one of the five kingdoms
    that emerged after the break up of the Bahamani Kingdom. The Qutb Shahis ruled the Deccan for almost 171 years. All
    the seven rulers were patrons of learning and were great builders. They contributed to the growth and development of
    Indo-Persian and Indo-Islamic literature and culture in Hyderabad. During the Qutb Shahi reign Golconda became one
    of the leading markets in the world of diamonds, pearls, steel for arms and also printed fabric. The glory of the
    Golconda kingdom ended in 1687, when Aurangzeb, the last great Mughal ruler, captured Golconda from Abul Hasan Tana
    Shah, the last king of Golconda. With the conquest of the Deccan and the South, Aurangzeb succeeded in expanding the
    Mughal Empire to cover the entire sub-continent. However, after his death in 1707, the Empire rapidly declined. At
    that time, Mir Quamaruddin, the Governor of the Deccan, who bore the title of Nizam-ul-Mulk Feroze Jung Asif Jah,
    declared his independence from Mughal rule in 1724. He thus became the first Nizam and the founder of the Asif Jahi
    dynasty.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">Best places to visit</h2><br><br>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">1. Char Minar</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    The epic signature of the city, Char Minar makes for a wonderful sight. Located in the heart of Hyderabad’s old
    city, surrounded by Mecca Masjid, built using bricks from Mecca and Laad Bazaar - a boisterous shopping street, this
    landmark is laced in history.

    Built in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah, it was constructed to commemorate the founding of Hyderabad and also to
    ward of a deadly epidemic that was rampant then in the Golconda region. Graced by 4 minarets soaring almost 50ft in
    height, it has a mosque and 45 prayer spaces is amongst the famous places in Hyderabad.

  <br><br>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">2. Golconda Fort</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    A medieval fort now overlooking the city, Golconda is one of the historical places to visit in Hyderabad. Originally
    built in mud on a 400ft hill, the fort ruins of today have seen the reign of several dynasties. Situated 11km away
    from the bustling urbanism of Hyderabad, it derives its name from a Telugu word meaning Shepherd’s Hill.
    Reminiscence of a well-planned Golconda city within the fortress limits is evident even now.

    The remains of multiple fortification layers, armories, magazines, mosques, granaries, reservoirs, audience chambers
    and royal dwellings complement the striking appearance of the fort.

    Famous for its acoustics, a unique signalling device that was incorporated in its construction, the structure is
    known for its palaces, ingenious water supply system and the famous Fateh Rahben, one of the cannons used in the
    last siege of Golconda by Aurangzeb. The Sound & Light show brings alive the grandeur of one of India’s famous
    forts.
