  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">About Tokyo</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">Tokyo (東京, Tōkyō) is Japan's capital and the
    world's most populous metropolis. It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures, consisting of 23 central city wards and
    multiple cities, towns and villages west of the city center. The Izu and Ogasawara Islands are also part of Tokyo.

    Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. A small castle town in the 16th century, Edo became Japan's political center
    in 1603 when Tokugawa Ieyasu established his feudal government there. A few decades later, Edo had grown into one of
    the world's most populous cities. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor and capital moved from Kyoto to
    Edo, which was renamed Tokyo ("Eastern Capital"). Large parts of Tokyo were destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake
    of 1923 and in the air raids of 1945.

    Today, Tokyo offers a seemingly unlimited choice of shopping, entertainment, culture and dining to its visitors. The
    city's history can be appreciated in districts such as Asakusa and in many excellent museums, historic temples and
    gardens. Contrary to common perception, Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green spaces in the city center and
    within relatively short train rides at its outskirts.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">Best places to visit</h2><br><br>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">1. Tour the The Imperial Palace</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    The chief attraction of Tokyo's Marunouchi district is the Imperial Palace (Kōkyo) with its beautiful 17th-century
    parks surrounded by walls and moats. Still in use by the Imperial family, the Imperial Palace stands on the site
    where, in 1457, the Feudal Lord Ota Dokan built the first fortress, the focal point from which the city of Tokyo (or
    Edo, as it was then) gradually spread.

    As famous as the palace is the Nijubashi Bridge leading to its interior, a structure that takes its name ("double
    bridge") from its reflection in the water. Other notable features include the two-meter-thick wall surrounding the
    palace and its gates, one of which leads to the East Higashi-Gyoen Garden.

    Tours of the Imperial Palace are available (pre-registration required) and include the Kikyo-mon Gate, Someikan
    (Visitors' House), Fujimi-yagura ("Mt. Fuji View" Keep), the East Gardens and Inner Gate, the Seimon-tetsubashi
    bridge, and the Imperial Household Agency Building (be sure to plan ahead).

    Another fortress that can be visited is Edo Castle (Chiyoda Castle). Built in 1457, it's located in Tokyo's Chiyoda
    district.

    Address: 1-1 Chiyoda, Chiyoda City, Tokyo 100-8111

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">2. Visit the Sensō-ji Temple</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    In the Asakusa district of Tokyo, the exquisite Sensō-ji Temple (Kinryū-zan Sensō-ji)) - the city's most famous
    shrine - stands at the end of a long street market hosting vendors selling masks, carvings, combs made of ebony and
    wood, toys, kimonos, fabrics, and precious paper goods.

    Dedicated to Kannon, the Buddhist goddess of compassion, the temple was established in AD 645 and retains its
    original appearance despite having been rebuilt numerous times.

    Highlights of a visit include seeing the Kaminari-mon Gate with its 3.3-meter-high red paper lantern bearing the
    inscription "Thunder Gate," as well as the famous and much-loved Incense Vat, reputed to drive away ailments (you'll
    see people cupping their hands around the smoke and applying it to the part of their body needing healing).

    Also of note are the fascinating temple doves, said to be Kannon's sacred messengers. Be sure to drop a coin in the
    Omikuji boxes near the entrance, from which you can retrieve a piece of paper that will tell your fortune.

    Afterwards, be sure to explore the rest of the 50-acre temple precinct with its warren of lanes. If you can, revisit
    the temple again at night for a completely different (and far less crowded) illuminated experience.

    Address: 2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa, Taito, Tokyo 111-0032

  <h2 style="margin-left: 10%;">3. Enjoy Nature at Ueno Park and Ueno Zoo</h2><br><br>
  <p style=" font-size: larger; margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">
    A paradise-like oasis of green in the heart of busy Tokyo, Ueno Park (Ueno Kōen) is the city's largest green space
    and one of its most popular tourist attractions. In addition to its lovely grounds, the park also boasts numerous
    temples and museums to explore.

    Criss-crossed by pleasant gravel paths, this 212-acre park includes highlights such as a trip on a small boat on the
    reed-fringed Shinobazu pond, around a little island with its Bentendo Temple. Be sure to also visit the 17th-century
    Toshogu Shrine (Nikkō Tōshō-gū), with its 256 bronze and stone lanterns.

    Another highlight here is Ueno Zoo (Onshi Ueno Dōbutsuen). Opened in 1882, it is Japan's oldest zoo, and is famous
    for the pandas presented by the People's Republic of China.

    While it's a large attraction and houses more than 3,00 animals representing some 400 species, having a fun monorail
    connecting its various components can help speed up a visit (and make it even more enjoyable).

    The Aqua-Zoo, one of the largest aquariums in Asia, is also worth a visit, especially if you're traveling with kids.
